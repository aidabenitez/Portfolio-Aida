# Portfolio_Aida

## Project analysis

### Target user profile
This web page is aimed mainly at employers who work in the branch of programming. As someone with quite a lot of experience with robotics and application programming, I think these sectors are the first targets. Even so, even if the main audience is companies that might be interested in my profile in order to work there, I have also taken into account other users. For example, I looked for many examples of portfolios before I started designing my own. So, I also think that those people who don't know how to design it, who are looking for examples, can also be a target.

### Information architecture
Regarding the organization of the contents, I have tried to divide the information into sections, columns and rows to facilitate navigation on the web. I have tried to follow an order when placing the information so that there is consistency when reading. So, we find the following sections:
	- Presentation: short description of what I like and a photo of me
	- About me: description of who I am, my knowledge and the different jobs in which I have worked
	- Projects: some of the projects I have developed that have allowed me to get here
	- Accomplishments: different prizes that I have obtained thanks to my projects
	- Technologies: the different programming languages ​​I know
Thanks to the appbar, usability is simplified as it is easier to find the sections. So, I think that with this structure it is easy to follow my steps in the field of programming.

### Visual design
Regarding the visual design, I looked for a color palette that was simple and tactful but at the same time attractive. For this reason, I have focused on different shades of green. For the typography, I tried different combinations until I found one that showed a more youthful but also worked design. Also, I've decided to add shading to the different containers so that the design looks more elaborate and doesn't look so flat. I have also added several images so that the user has evidence of what I have done and, in this way, give a closer profile of what I am like. In this way, with this design I think that the user's visual experience will be pleasant.
